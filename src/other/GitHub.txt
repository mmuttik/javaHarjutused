pwd  			                        kus olen?
cd 			                            mine/go

git add --all
git commit -m "kommentaar"
git push

git show HEAD                           shows HEAD commit
git checkout HEAD "filename"            will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit
git reset HEAD "filename"               resets the file in the staging area to be the same as the HEAD commit. It does not discard file changes from the working directory, it just removes them from the staging area

---Git Branching---

git branch                               “which branch am I on?”
git branch new_branch                    new_branch would be the name of the new branch you create, like photos or blurb. Be sure to name your branch something that describes the purpose of the branch. Also, branch names can’t contain whitespaces: new-branch and new_branch are valid branch names, but new branch is not
git checkout branch_name                 switch branch; make commits on the new branch
git merge branch_name                    merge branches
